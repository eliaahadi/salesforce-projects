## Salesforce grants management mini app (portfolio)

A lightweight Salesforce implementation that models a grants lifecycle end-to-end and demonstrates enterprise patterns:
- Data model for grants, applications, review, awards, disbursements, compliance artifacts
- Workflow automation using Salesforce Flow (submit application, approve award)
- Security model talk track (least privilege, record sharing, field security)
- Integration design patterns (API-led via middleware, event-driven option)
- Reporting dashboard for program KPIs

### Why this project
This mirrors common public-sector CRM/grants modernization needs:
- Structured lifecycle and audit trail
- Case management for applicant support
- Integrations to finance, identity, and document systems
- Governance and release discipline

### Quick start (demo)
1. Create sample records (Grant program → Grant → Applicant org/contact → Applications)
2. Update an application status to `Submitted` to trigger submit flow
3. Update an application status to `Approved` to trigger award creation flow
4. View dashboard for pipeline and dollars
